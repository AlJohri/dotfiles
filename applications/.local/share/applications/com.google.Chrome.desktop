# Google Chrome installs two desktop entries:
#   /usr/share/applications/google-chrome.desktop      (traditional naming)
#   /usr/share/applications/com.google.Chrome.desktop  (reverse-domain/Flatpak style)
#
# On Arch Linux, the traditional naming is idiomatic. Hide this one to
# prevent duplicate entries in Walker and other application launchers.
