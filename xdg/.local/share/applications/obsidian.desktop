# Override: /usr/share/applications/obsidian.desktop
#
# This file overrides the system Obsidian desktop entry so that launching Obsidian
# from Walker (or any application launcher) uses toggle-special-app instead
# of launching a new instance. This enables:
#   - Starting Obsidian if not already running
#   - Bringing Obsidian to the current workspace if hidden in a special workspace
#   - Consistent behavior with the SUPER+SHIFT+O keybinding
#
# The XDG spec gives ~/.local/share/applications/ priority over /usr/share/applications/
# when filenames match, so this file takes precedence.
