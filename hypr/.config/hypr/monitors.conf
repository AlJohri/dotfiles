# Hyprland Monitor Configuration
# See https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Monitors/
# Omarchy defaults: https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy/blob/master/config/hypr/monitors.conf
#
# Use description-based matching (desc:) instead of port names (DP-1, HDMI-A-1, etc.)
# Port names change depending on which dock/port you plug into, but descriptions
# are stable because they're based on the monitor's EDID (make/model/serial).
#
# To find monitor descriptions:
#   hyprctl monitors | grep -E "^Monitor|description"
#
# Format: monitor = <name>, <resolution>, <position>, <scale>
#   - name: port name (DP-1) or desc:Description to match by EDID
#   - resolution: WxH@Hz, preferred, or highres/highrr
#   - position: XxY coordinates or auto
#   - scale: fractional scaling factor (1 = 100%, 1.5 = 150%, etc.)
#
# NOTE: Using v1 syntax (monitor = ...) instead of monitorv2 {} blocks due to bug:
# https://github.com/hyprwm/Hyprland/discussions/12996

# Framework 16 laptop display (2560x1600 @ 165Hz, 16" panel)
# Scale 1.6 gives 1600x1000 logical resolution
monitor = desc:BOE 0x0BC9, preferred, 0x0, 1.6

# Acer P236H (1920x1080, 23")
# Position 1600x0 = right of laptop (laptop is 1600 logical pixels wide at 1.6 scale)
monitor = desc:Acer Technologies Acer P236H, preferred, 1600x0, 1

# Dell U3415W (3440x1440, 34" ultrawide)
# Scale 1.67 gives ~2060x862 logical resolution
# Position 1600x0 = right of laptop (laptop is 1600 logical pixels wide at 1.6 scale)
monitor = desc:Dell Inc. DELL U3415W PXF7994P0P6L, preferred, 1600x0, 1.67

# Catch-all for any other external monitors
# Uses 1.33 scale as a reasonable default for most modern displays
monitor = , preferred, auto, 1.33
