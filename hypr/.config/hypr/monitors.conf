# Hyprland Monitor Configuration
# See https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Monitors/
# Omarchy defaults: https://github.com/basecamp/omarchy/blob/master/config/hypr/monitors.conf
#
# Use description-based matching (desc:) instead of port names (DP-1, HDMI-A-1, etc.)
# Port names change depending on which dock/port you plug into, but descriptions
# are stable because they're based on the monitor's EDID (make/model/serial).
#
# To find monitor descriptions:
#   hyprctl monitors | grep -E "^Monitor|description"
#
# Format: monitor = <name>, <resolution>, <position>, <scale>
#   - name: port name (DP-1) or desc:Description to match by EDID
#   - resolution: WxH@Hz, preferred, or highres/highrr
#   - position: XxY coordinates or auto
#   - scale: fractional scaling factor (1 = 100%, 1.5 = 150%, etc.)

# Framework 16 laptop display (2560x1600 @ 165Hz, 16" panel)
# Scale 1.6 gives 1600x1000 logical resolution
monitorv2 {
  output = desc:BOE 0x0BC9
  mode = preferred
  position = 0x0
  scale = 1.6
}

# Acer P236H (1920x1080, 23") - home office monitor
# Scale 1 for native 1080p resolution, positioned to the right of laptop
monitorv2 {
  output = desc:Acer Technologies Acer P236H
  mode = preferred
  position = 1600x0
  scale = 1
}

# Catch-all for any other external monitors
# Uses 1.33 scale as a reasonable default for most modern displays
monitorv2 {
  output =
  mode = preferred
  position = auto
  scale = 1.33
}
